# Zhora Giveaway Script for FiveM

A powerful and easy-to-use giveaway script for FiveM servers running the ESX framework. This script allows administrators to create, manage, and announce giveaways for items, money, weapons, and vehicles through a modern and intuitive React-based UI.

## ✨ Features

### 🎁 Versatile Giveaways
Create giveaways for a wide range of items, including:
- **Standard Items** (requires ox_inventory or standard ESX)
- **Cash** (money)
- **Black Money** (black_money)
- **Player Licenses**
- **Vehicles** (spawned directly into the player's garage)

### 🔄 Dynamic Item List
The admin panel automatically fetches and populates the item list for giveaways directly from your configured inventory system. It seamlessly pulls from ox_inventory exports or your ESX items database table, ensuring all available items are ready to be gifted.

### 🖥️ Modern Admin Panel
A clean and responsive user interface built with React and Vite for easy management:
- Start new giveaways with customizable duration, winner count, and item quantity
- Manage a list of pre-configured giveaway items for quick and easy setup
- View a detailed history of past giveaways, including prizes and winners

### ⚙️ Flexible Configuration
- Easily configure admin roles, commands, and default giveaway settings
- Multi-language support (English and German included by default)
- Seamless integration with different announcement systems (ns_announce, chat, or custom events/exports)
- Customizable vehicle plate generation

### 🎮 Simple for Players
Players can join active giveaways with a single command (`/enter`).

### ⚡ Robust and Optimized
The script is designed for performance and reliability.

## 📋 Dependencies

- **ESX Framework** (tested with ESX Legacy)
- **oxmysql**
- **ox_inventory** (can be configured for standard ESX item handling)
- **Announcement script** like ns_announce is recommended for the best experience, but it can be configured to use the standard chat or other systems

   ```bash
   # Download the zhora_giveaway files and place them in your server's resources directory
